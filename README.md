# Hangman Game

In this project, I used `React` <img src="./public/react.png" alt="wrong letter" width="15"/> and `Typescript` <img src="./public/typescript.png" alt="wrong letter" width="15"/> to create a Hangman game.

## Live Demo

You can try the game yourself at:

## How to play

This game is pretty simple and straight forward. All you have to do is to guess a word by suggesting letters within 6 guesses otherwise you are doneðŸ’€.

No worries as you can simply press the `Enter` key to start a new round with a new word.

Have fun ðŸ˜€
